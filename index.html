    <!-- <h2>Summary</h2> -->

    <p>Chesapeake Commons began deploying updates to Ashtracker in April 2015. At that time, additional tracking measures were added to better gage system use and performance. Detailed logging began in June 2015. The data presented here are taken from a six-month period ending in December 2015.</p>

    <span style="font-size: 2em; display: block; text-align: center; padding: 0.5em 0;">&#9670;</span>

    <h2>Overall</h2>

    <span style="font-size: 2em; display: block; text-align: center; padding: 0.5em 0;">&#9670;</span>

    <p><span class="stat">11,884</span> page views by <span class="stat">2,367</span> unique visitors since May 2014</p>

    <span style="font-size: 2em; display: block; text-align: center; padding: 0.5em 0;">&#9670;</span>

    <h2>6-month summary</h2>

    <span style="font-size: 2em; display: block; text-align: center; padding: 0.5em 0;">&#9670;</span>

    <p>Served valid requests to <span class="stat">390</span> unique IPs in 36 states</p>

    <p><span class="stat">3,912</span> page views (excluding EIP and CC)</p>

    <p>Approximately <span class="stat">50</span> unique sessions per month</p>

    <span style="font-size: 2em; display: block; text-align: center; padding: 0.5em 0;">&#9670;</span>

    <h2>Page traffic</h2>

    <span style="font-size: 2em; display: block; text-align: center; padding: 0.5em 0;">&#9670;</span>

    <p><span class="stat">20%</span> of users visited the landing page</p>

    <!-- <p>Among users accessing the landing page, roughly 42% enter the site and then leave rather than continuing on to other pages. The overall bounce rate is approximately 38%.</p> -->

    <p><span class="stat">60%</span> viewed top-level facility pages (all have been seen at least once)</p>

    <p><span class="stat">3%</span> viewed facility &rarr; contaminant pages</p>

    <p><span class="stat">7%</span> viewed well profile pages</p>

    <p><span class="stat">1%</span> viewed well &rarr; contaminant pages</p>

    <!-- <p><span class="stat">7%</span> top-level well page views</p> -->

    <!-- <p><span class="stat">3%</span> facility > contaminant page views</p> -->

    <!-- <p><span class="stat">60%</span> top-level facility page views (all have been seen at least once)</p> -->

    <p>Among users accessing the landing page, roughly 42% enter the site and then leave rather than continuing on to other pages. The overall bounce rate is approximately 38%.</p>

    <p><b>Recommendation:</b> Concentrate future development on high-traffic areas, specifically the landing page and facility profiles. Determine what information is critical to include in facility profiles and summarize data more clearly. Users would likely benefit from more organized, streamlined content. Additionally, note that users arriving via search engines primarily use facility names as query terms. Implementing Google's Sitelinks Search Box could offer a way for users to find facilities directly from the Google search platform.</p>

    <h2>Traffic patterns</h2>

    <span style="font-size: 2em; display: block; text-align: center; padding: 0.5em 0;">&#9670;</span>

    <p><span class="stat">75%</span> of facility page views are from origins other than the landing page. The landing page isn't a high-volume funnel to facility pages.</p>

    <p>About <span class="stat">21%</span> of users viewed 10 or more pages, so there is an appetite for content.</p>

    <p>In terms of page requests, there is <span class="stat">100%</span> use for facilities but only <span class="stat">5%</span> for wells.</p>

    <p><span class="stat">9%</span> of visitors return to Ashtracker more than once.</p>

    <p><b>Recommendation:</b> Move deep-lying information up the page hierarchy and increase the searchability of facility profiles. In addition, capture the attention of users by including more information on the landing page, specifically: recent facility updates; summary statistics; introductory text; curated analyses and key findings; and global keyword search. Another strategy is to create more access points and internal links throughout the site to encourage exploration.</p>

    <p>In terms of retention, Ashtracker could offer subscriptions to a feed or notification list that receives updates about changes and reports as they're released by EIP. The system could also integrate with the existing Twitter account to trigger alerts when new data is brought online. Finally, the range of profiles could be expanded to include companies and/or geographies so that users not interested by specific details would still have useful content to consume.</p>

    <h2>Data access</h2>

    <span style="font-size: 2em; display: block; text-align: center; padding: 0.5em 0;">&#9670;</span>

    <p><span class="stat">9%</span> of visitors used the reading explorer page</p>

    <!-- <p><span class="stat">9%</span> of visitors return to Ashtracker more than once</p> -->

    <p><span class="stat">9</span> export requests from <span class="stat">8</span> users at <span class="stat">7</span> facilities</p>

    <p><b>Recommendation:</b> Take advantage of facility page use to increase data access. Users may balk at providing an email address, so an alternative could be to offer file downloads again or retain the current export method while removing the email input. Moving the data download button to a more prominent location and adding tags for tracking may also be beneficial.</p>
